  ### **Custom GPT-2 Build**
  - Implemented a 12-layer GPT with bfloat16 DDP, cosine LR decay, grad accum & KV-cache for 20x faster inference
  - Tokenized 10B FineWeb tokens & ran a 20-step proof-of concept, reducing val loss from 10.99 to 7.62 (0.246 on HellaSwag MC1)  
  
  ### **FlightPath: Professional Networking Web App**
  - Directed development of a full-stack LinkedIn-style app with 4 roles: students, employers, professors, university admin
  - Engineered a secure, responsive, scalable UI with role-based navigation & AWS hosting across 40+ components
  - Managed agile development cycles across 3 groups: developers, sponsor, & university administration  
  
  ### **Makemore Character-Level Language Model**
  - Trained a 75k+ parameter neural network on 30k+ character sequences using backpropagation and gradient descent
  - Reduced loss from 3.6 to 1.76, outperforming the random baseline of 2.30 for a 27-token vocabulary
  - Visualized 3 training loss curves and sampled 100+ text outputs to assess model performance and tune architecture  
  
  ### **AI Basketball Predictor**
  - Tuned hyperparameters via grid search & cross validation, achieving over 75% game-result accuracy
  - Tuned hyperparameters via grid search and cross-validation across 500+ training iterations
  - Packaged into a reusable Python module with an evaluation dashboard visualizing predictions across 12 metrics  
  
  ### **Network Security Testbed with Detection & Dashboard**
  - Detected & labeled 5 attack types (ARP poisoning, DDoS, port scan, etc.) in real time using custom IDS scripts  
  - Implemented a secure data pipeline, processed 20k packets per run, displayed insights into an InfluxDB dashboard
  - Personally secured $4,000 in research funding for summer work through a competitive fellowship program and led 2 presentations to a DoD representative, contributing to continued funding of a $591,000 cybersecurity grant  
  
  ### **Wordle Entropy Solver**
  - Achieved 100% solve rate with an average of 3.70 guesses per word  
  - Prunes candidates by feedback patterns & reports solve rates for performance metrics
