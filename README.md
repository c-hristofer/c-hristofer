# Hi, I'm Christofer Piedra 👋  
  
I am a software engineer with a passion for full‑stack web development, machine learning, cybersecurity research, and systems programming. My work spans academic research projects, commercial platforms, and personal experiments. I software that solves real-world problems. My expertise covers modern JavaScript frameworks, Python for data and AI, C/C++ for systems, and cloud services for production‑grade deployments.

  <br/>

  ### **FlightPath: Professional Networking Web App**
- Directed development of a full-stack LinkedIn-style app with 4 roles: students, employers, professors, university admin  
- Engineered a secure, responsive, scalable UI with role-based navigation & AWS hosting across 40+ components  
- Managed agile development cycles across 3 groups: developers, sponsor, & university administration

  ### **Network Security Testbed with Detection & Dashboard**
- Detected & labeled 5 attack types (ARP poisoning, DDoS, port scan, etc.) in real time using custom IDS scripts  
- Implemented a secure data pipeline, processed 20k packets per run, displayed insights into an InfluxDB dashboard  
- Personally secured $4,000 in research funding for summer work through a competitive fellowship program and led 2 presentations to a DoD representative, contributing to continued funding of a $591,000 cybersecurity grant

  ### **Personal Website & Portfolio**
- Developed a responsive single-page application using React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS to serve as a central hub for my résumé and project portfolio.  
- Added showcases for major projects: demos of the FlightPath platform, an AI transformer playground, a sports analytics dashboard, and visualizations of intrusion detection metrics.  
- Implemented markdown-based blog support, SEO optimization, and automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.

  ### **Custom GPT-2 Build**
- Implemented a 12-layer GPT with bfloat16 DDP, cosine LR decay, grad accum & KV-cache for 20x faster inference  
- Tokenized 10B FineWeb tokens & ran a 20-step proof-of concept, reducing val loss from 10.99 to 7.62 (0.246 on HellaSwag MC1)

  ### **Makemore Character-Level Language Model**
- Trained a 75k+ parameter neural network on 30k+ character sequences using backpropagation and gradient descent  
- Reduced loss from 3.6 to 1.76, outperforming the random baseline of 2.30 for a 27-token vocabulary  
- Visualized 3 training loss curves and sampled 100+ text outputs to assess model performance and tune architecture

  ### **AI Basketball Predictor**
- Tuned hyperparameters via grid search & cross validation, achieving over 75% game-result accuracy  
- Tuned hyperparameters via grid search and cross-validation across 500+ training iterations  
- Packaged into a reusable Python module with an evaluation dashboard visualizing predictions across 12 metrics

  ### **GPT Experimentation Repository**
- Provides pretraining and fine‑tuning scripts for GPT‑2–style models with configurable hyperparameters (layer count, head size, context length).  
- Supports loading and evaluating OpenAI GPT‑2 checkpoints and generating text via CLI or web interface.  
- Implements distributed data parallel training with gradient checkpointing to scale across multiple GPUs, enabling training of models beyond single-card memory limits.

  ### **Voltage Robotics Team Website**
- Designed and built a static site for Team Voltage using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, featuring competition news, team member bios, and sponsor acknowledgments.  
- Ensured mobile-first responsiveness and optimized images to sustain lighthouse scores above 95%; integrated Firebase Auth–secured admin tools for content updates via a headless CMS.  
- Deployed the site with automated builds and incorporated analytics to track engagement during competition season.

### **Mechanical Maniacs FLL Site**
- Created a dynamic website for the Mechanical Maniacs FLL 2025 season using React and Firebase Hosting.  
- Architected an interactive timeline and mission tracker aligned with the season’s archaeology theme and provided a headless CMS for team members to add blog posts, photos, and project updates without code changes.  
- Integrated Google Analytics for user engagement insights and iterated on features to enhance visitor interaction.

  ### **Wordle Entropy Solver**
- Achieved 100% solve rate with an average of 3.70 guesses per word  
- Prunes candidates by feedback patterns & reports solve rates for performance metrics
